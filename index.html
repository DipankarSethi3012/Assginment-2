            <h2>The Conjuring</h2>
            <img src="./download.jpg" alt="" title="7">
           <p>The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan and written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. It is the inaugural film in The Conjuring Universe franchise.[4] Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent cases of haunting. Their purportedly real-life reports inspired The Amityville Horror story and film franchise.[5] The Warrens come to the assistance of the Perron family, who experienced increasingly disturbing events in their newly occupied farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971.

            Development of the film began in January 2012, and reports confirmed Wan as the director of a film entitled The Warren Files, later retitled The Conjuring, centering on the alleged real-life exploits of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a married couple who investigated paranormal events. In his second collaboration with Wan, Patrick Wilson starred alongside Vera Farmiga in the main roles of Ed and Lorraine. Production commenced in Wilmington, North Carolina, in February 2012, and scenes were shot in chronological order.
            
            The Conjuring was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, direction, screenplay, atmosphere, and musical score. It grossed over $319 million worldwide against its $20 million budget. A sequel, The Conjuring 2, was released in 2016.n 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island, with their five daughters: Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house and the entrance to a cellar has been boarded up. Paranormal events occur within the first few nights. Every clock in the house stops at 3:07 AM. Sadie is found dead in the morning, and Carolyn wakes up with large bruises. She and Christine both encounter a malevolent spirit.

            Carolyn contacts demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have recently investigated a possessed doll called Annabelle. The Warrens meet with Carolyn and agree to conduct an initial investigation, during which Lorraine, a clairvoyant, sees that dark forces have latched on to the Perron family, and leaving the house will not free them. To gather evidence, they place cameras and bells around the house with the help of their assistant Drew Thomas and police officer Brad Hamilton. Further research reveals that the house once belonged to an accused witch named Bathsheba Sherman (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey), who sacrificed her week-old baby to the devil and killed herself in 1863 at 3:07 in the morning after cursing all who take her land. There are reports of numerous murders and suicides through the years in the houses that were built on the property.
            
            One morning, Bathsheba appears to Carolyn and fully possesses her. That night, the group hears a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage. Lorraine enters the passage and falls down to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had possessed long ago and used to kill her child. Bathsheba attacks Nancy; the incident is caught on camera. The Warrens conclude it is sufficient evidence to receive authorization from the Catholic Church to perform an exorcism but Father Gordon explains that approval would have to come directly from the Vatican because the Perron family aren't members of the church.
            
            The Warrens' daughter Judy is attacked in the Warrens' own home by Bathsheba. The Perron family takes refuge at a motel but Carolyn takes Christine and April back to the house to kill them. Ed, Lorraine, and Brad find Carolyn in the cellar trying to stab Christine. Lorraine warns that if they take Carolyn outside the house, Bathsheba will kill her. They tie Carolyn to a chair and Ed attempts the exorcism himself. Though Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April, Lorraine is able to call to her by reminding her of a special memory she shared with her family, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism, lift Bathsheba's curse and condemn her back to Hell. Returning home, Ed adds the haunted music box from the Perrons' home to their room of cursed artifacts that they have collected from past cases. As he leaves, the music box starts playing on its own.</p>

            <h2>The Popes of Exorcist</h2>
            <img src="./images.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Pope's Exorcist is a 2023 American supernatural horror film directed by Julius Avery from a screenplay by Michael Petroni and Evan Spiliotopoulos, based on the 1990 book An Exorcist Tells His Story and the 1992 book An Exorcist: More Stories by Father Gabriele Amorth.[5] The film stars Russell Crowe as Amorth, with Daniel Zovatto, Alex Essoe, and Franco Nero in supporting roles.

                Production began in 2020 when Screen Gems purchased the rights to Amorth's story. After a directorial replacement and script revisions, filming took place from August to October 2022 in Ireland.
                
                The Pope's Exorcist was released in several international countries beginning on April 6, 2023, and in the United States and Canada on April 14.[6] The film received mixed reviews from critics.Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, an earthy, whiskey-swigging, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man, arrives at an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon. With the local priest, Amorth enters the room where the man is tied up. While exorcising the man, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, he drives the demon into a pig, which is then killed with a shotgun.

                This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist, and that he did not perform a true exorcism, but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally-disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.
                
                The Pope assigns him to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident in which Henry was also present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Workmen, who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave after a sinister fire. Henry starts behaving bizarrely; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing abnormal.
                
                Henry, diabolically possessed, requests a priest; the local Father Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides him. Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth says, "They're good books." Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him, mocking him for his sins.
                
                The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite. Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood, but he convinces her to pray after she reveals she believed her guardian angel helped her in childhood.
                
                In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case, and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up, and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.

Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing, and absolving each other of, their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, a mentally-ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride; and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry. The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace. During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed. The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.

Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon, and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men. The Pope recovers, as does Henry.

The triumphant duo visit Rome, and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive; Lumumba tells them they will be visiting hundreds of other evil sites, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil. Amorth jokingly says, "We're going to Hell!" Finally, words on the screen narrate details about Amorth's papal-exorcist career, including his writing many books, and "The books are good."

An after-credits photo of the real Amorth sticking out his tongue appears, along with his birth and death dates.

            <h2>The Evil Dead 4</h2>
            <img src="./download (1).jpg" alt="">
            <p>Evil Dead is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by Fede Álvarez (in his feature directorial debut), who co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. Dubbed a "re-imagining" of The Evil Dead (1981), the film is the fourth installment in the Evil Dead film series.[a] It stars Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore. The story follows a group of five people under attack by a supernatural entity in a remote cabin in the woods.

                Talks for a fourth Evil Dead film began in 2004, with original film actor Bruce Campbell about the possibility for a next film in the franchise. The project was officially announced in July 2011, with Ghost House Pictures producing it, Diablo Cody in the process of revising the script, and Fede Álvarez chosen as the director. Much of the cast joined from January to February 2012. Principal photography took place in March 2012 and wrapped in May in New Zealand outside of Auckland, lasting about a month.[3]
                
                Evil Dead had its premiere at South by Southwest on March 8, 2013, and was released in the United States on April 5, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The film grossed $97 million worldwide against a production budget of $17 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the series. A new installment, titled Evil Dead Rise, will be released by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on April 21, 2023.A teenage girl runs through the woods until she is caught by two pursuing hillbillies. Subdued with a sack over her head, she awakens to find herself tied up in the fruit cellar of a remote cabin, where an old woman is reciting incantations from a strange book. The girl pleads with her father Harold to release her. After he refuses, she reveals her possession by a demonic spirit and threatens to kill him. Harold sets her ablaze and shoots her dead.

                Three years later, David Allen and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at the cabin with their dog Grandpa, where they meet his estranged younger sister Mia and her friends Eric, a high school teacher, and Olivia, a nurse. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her heroin addiction. Mia begins having serious withdrawal symptoms and complains of an overwhelming scent of decay, which the others ignore. David discovers that the cabin's cellar is littered with rotting animal corpses, a worn double-barrel shotgun, and a book called the Naturom Demonto.
                
                A curious Eric reads an incantation from the book, awakening a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing visions of a demonic doppelgänger of herself in the woods and begs the group to leave. They refuse, thinking that she must be seeing hallucinations. Mia steals Eric's car and leaves, but sees her doppelgänger and swerves, crashing into a pond. She is chased by the force into the woods, tripping into a bramble where vines from a tree trap her. Mia's doppelgänger appears, regurgitating a sentient vine that enters her body, possessing her.
                
                David finds Grandpa beaten to death with a hammer and goes to confront Mia in the shower. He discovers her scalding herself and tries to drive her to a hospital, but a sudden rainstorm washes out the road. That night, a possessed Mia wounds her brother with the shotgun, declares that they are all going to die tonight, and vomits a large amount of red bile onto Olivia's face before Eric manages to lock her in the basement. Olivia is later possessed. When Eric discovers her in the shower mutilating her face, she stabs him repeatedly with a hypodermic needle before he bludgeons her to death. Mia lures Natalie into the cellar and bites her hand before slicing her own tongue apart with a box cutter, and then forcibly kissing her. David helps her escape before locking Mia back in.
                
                Eric explains that according to the book, the "Taker of Souls" must claim five souls to unleash the "Abomination". Natalie's arm soon becomes possessed and she amputates it with an electric knife. Eric explains that Mia must be "purified" either by live burial, dismemberment, or burning. The now-possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David shoots her other arm off; Natalie returns to normal but soon bleeds to death from her injury.
                
                David begins to douse the cabin in gasoline, but when Mia starts singing a song from their childhood, he decides to bury her instead. He digs a grave and heads into the cellar to retrieve Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes but is fatally stabbed. David sedates and buries Mia, and after hearing her heartbeat stop, quickly digs her up and attempts to use a homemade defibrillator to resuscitate her. After several seemingly failed attempts, David covers his sister and says she's "at peace". Returning to the cabin, he hears a voice behind him and finds Mia alive. David enters the cabin to retrieve his car keys, but Eric's possessed corpse stabs him. David locks Mia out to protect her and shoots a gasoline can, killing both him and Eric in the resulting blaze.
                
                With David's death being the fifth claimed soul, blood begins to rain down from the sky and Mia is attacked by the Abomination in the form of her demonic doppelgänger. Mia finds a chainsaw and severs the Abomination's legs, but it retaliates by overturning David's Jeep which lands on her left arm and traps her. Pushed to her breaking point, Mia frees herself by amputating her left hand, grabs the chainsaw, and bisects the Abomination's head before it sinks back into the ground and the rain stops. An exhausted Mia leaves to search for help, unaware the Naturom Demonto is still intact, and slamming shut on its own.
                
                In a post-credits scene, an older Ash Williams (the protagonist of the original three Evil Dead films) is seen in shadowed profile.</p>
